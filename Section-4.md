# Section - 4 
# Level - 1 - Grabbing Just 1 Commit

This level focuses on selecting a single required commit from multiple commits.

Interactive rebase is used to choose or remove commits, and rebase is applied to update the main branch.

Only the necessary commit is moved forward while unnecessary commits are skipped.
